Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears twice except for one element which appears once. 
Find this single element that appears only once.

public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
    int left = 0;
    int right = nums.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        int mid = (left + right) / 2;
        if (mid % 2 == 1) mid--;

        if (nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]) left = mid + 2;
        else right = mid;
    }

    return nums[left];
}
