Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. 
It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
    int h = height(root);
    if (h < 0) return 0;

    if (height(root.right) == h - 1)
        return (1 << h) + countNodes(root.right);
    else 
        return (1 << h - 1) + countNodes(root.left);
}

private static int height(TreeNode root) {
    int height = -1;
    while (root != null) {
        height++;
        root = root.left;
    }
    return height;
}
