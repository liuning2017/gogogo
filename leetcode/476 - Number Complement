Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
Example 1: Input: 5, Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

public int findComplement(int num) {
    int mask = (int)Math.pow(2, 30);
    boolean flag = false;
    while ((num & mask) == 0) {
        mask >>= 1;
        flag = true;
    }

    if (flag) {
        mask <<= 1;
        mask -= 1;
    } else {
        mask = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    }

    return ~num & mask;
}
