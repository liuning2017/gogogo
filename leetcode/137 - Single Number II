Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.
Note: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += (num >> i) & 1;
        }
        res |= (sum % 3) << i;
    }

    return res;
}
