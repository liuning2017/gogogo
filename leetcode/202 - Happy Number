Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy". A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, 
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. 
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Example: 19 is a happy number
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

public boolean isHappy(int n) {
    // All non-happy numbers follow sequences that reach the cycle:
    // 4, 16, 37, 58, 89, 145, 42, 20, 4, ...
    // So there must a 4 in the cycle of non-happy numbres
    while (n != 1 && n != 4) {
        n = nextNumber(n);
    }
    return n == 1;
}

private int nextNumber(int n) {
    int res = 0;
    while (n > 0) {
        int a = n % 10;
        res +=  a * a;
        n /= 10;
    }
    return res;
}
